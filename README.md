### Design Concept
The main concept of this prototype is to hit the targets as they come on the screen before they fade away and dodge another type of target before it “hits” you. The game becomes progressively harder and more rewarding based on time, meaning targets that need to be hit are in higher quantities and fade away faster as well as targets that need to be dodged appear more frequently and “hit” you faster.
